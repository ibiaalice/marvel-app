## An amazing app that lists Marvel characters. 🦸🏻‍♂️🦹🏽

Hi, if you've come this far looking for an official app, sorry. This code was developed by a very geeky fan who was excited to discover an api!

If  you want to continue and run this app, I have some **conditions**:

- have a machine with Flutter 3.0;
- have a min Dart SDK 2.x
- have a mobile emulator (Android or IOS)*;
   > in case it doesn't, the app runs in the chrome browser, but it's not sure to contain all the functionality. 

### Run app

to run the app, you need to follow the steps:

1. Open the repository: 
```cd marvel_app```

2. Download dependencies:
``` flutter pub get ```

3. Generate the project's auxiliary files:
``` flutter pub run build_runner build ```

> if an error occurs in this step, consider running the following command ```flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs```

4. run the app
```flutter run ```
